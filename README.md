# Denoising and Deblurring Signals:

• Used concepts of Convolution, Fourier Transform, Inverse Fourier
Transform to denoise and deblur a given distorted signal.

• Conducted comparative study about effect of first denoise and then
deblur and vice-versa. (Applications in Communication Technology)

# NOTE: Dataset used is PCA_MNIST
Here I have demonstrated effect of dimensionality reduction (using PCA) on picture quality and reversing the effect on MNIST dataset.
